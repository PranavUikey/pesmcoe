### Why this course?
We use a different training model as opposed to classroom training which can be mundane and also unfair as it doesn't go by everyone's pace. With AI Adventures, you have access to a self paced course which covers the fundamentals of python with a strong focus on implementation. 

### What will you learn by the end of the course?
By the end of this course, you will be able to write simple but useful python programs and also be confident in your ability to learn new technologies and concepts.

### Why learn python?
Python is one of the most widely used programming languages. It has a strong open source community and is used in various domains like machine learning, web development, scientific computing and many more. It was rated the most important skill on the stack overflow developer survey for the past two years in a row! 

<!-- ### Will I get a certificate when Iâ€™ve finished the course?
Yes. Additionally, the top performing students will also be featured on the [rankings section]({{ site.baseurl }}/rankings) of our website :) -->

<!-- ### What is the expected workload?
The timings for the weekday batch will be from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM IST. The sessions will last from Monday to Friday with a holiday on Thursday. The total workload along with homework assignments will be ~20 hours  -->

### How can I learn machine learning?
If you like what we have to offer, we have a comprehensive course on machine learning which is built from the ground up! You will learn about data cleaning using modules like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/). The course also covers data analysis and visualizations through [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). We then proceed to explore the theory of machine learning and implement it using [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)!
