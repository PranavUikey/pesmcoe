## Welcome to Python for Data Science!

During the course of the next week, we aim to get you acquainted with Python and expose you to industrial Data Science projects. Strap in, cause it is going to be a fun ride! 

### The website

This website is where you will find most of our material. 
- Home: Here you will find some blog posts (like this one) which will help answer some key questions most people have about machine learning. 
- Prerequisites: Install Anaconda! A must have for data scientists.
- Resources: The tab where you will find all the content you are supposed to go through.
<!-- - Roadmap: This section provides a timeline of all the different topics covered in this course.  -->
- Rankings: Confident about your skills? Now is your time to shine! You will find the best performing students of past batches in this section. Want to add your name to it? Make sure you finish in the top 5.
- FAQs: This section will answer all of the common doubts or queries which you may have regarding this course.

### Course methodology

- Implementation focused: This course aims to make students learn by coding themselves rather than watch someone else. We have found that this method of learning makes the students independent and facilitates them to learn new technologies in the future with ease. 
- Asking for help: Students programming for the first time will naturally need help. Remember that we are here to help! Don't be afraid to ask for help regarding any topic you come across.
- Not a classroom: We encourage you to interact not just with other students, but with the volunteers as well. If you need a break, you can simply take one! No need to ask. Just makes sure that you submit your assignments before their respective deadlines and are present during the last hour of the day as we have some real life use cases planned for you.

### Course content

- Quizzes and assignments: Your task is to go through these while studying all the supplementary material provided within the notebooks themselves. 
- Submitting answers: The quizzes and assignments contain a link to a google form that you can use to submit the solutions before the associated deadline. Once the deadline is over, you can check out where you stand in the rankings tab. Every quiz and assignment will get you a certain number of credits depending on your performance. At the end of the course, the top 2 students will get exciting prizes and the top 5 students will be immortalized on the website!

- Data Science use cases: At the end of the day, we will have a different data science use case to discuss. These use cases are a great way for you to get in the mind of a data scientist. We will also be discussing some state of the art technologies and advances in various domains of artificial intelligence.

### Course target

No matter what your background, we are confident that you will learn something new!
- Complete beginner to programming: The course material should be a perfect fit for you :). The material starts with the fundamentals of programming. Python is a great language to learn as your first language because of its simple learning curve so you have made the right decision choosing it!
- Familiarity with other languages: Your task is to map the syntax. You already know the basics of programming and you just have to figure out how to replicate what you know in python.
- Used Python before: Shoot for the moon! See if you can get yourself to the top of the leaderboard. Make full use of this opportunity by attending the use cases, ask a lot of questions and interact with your peers.
