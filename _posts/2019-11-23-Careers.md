### What is AI?
It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.

### Myths vs Reality

#### Myth 1: AI is a very new field.

The term “artificial intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy way back in the year 1956. Even though the concept of AI isn’t new, it has been creating more of a buzz across the globe in recent years.

#### Myth 2: You need to have a PhD to practice AI

This is probably one of the biggest myths, the reality is you can learn as well as practice AI from the comfort of your home. Today there are many online learning platforms available for you to join and develop your skills in AI and enrich your resume – CloudXLab is one of them.

#### Myth 3: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning are the same

This is a very common misconception. AI is often misconstrued with Machine Learning, Deep Learning. But the truth is that machine learning is a subset of AI and is one of the ways of creating an AI, and deep learning is a subset of machine learning.

#### Myth 4: AI is only for tech companies

The initiation of AI is undoubtedly driven by technology companies. But now it is increasingly being incorporated by other industries and sectors. Right from healthcare to financial sectors, BFSI to e-commerce, FMGC and so on, every single vertical is keen to devour the AI-powered opportunities to yield significant benefits.

#### Myth 5: A career in AI demands specialization

You may read this everywhere. As an AI aspirant, you need to have skills and exposure in Statistics and probability, Applied Maths, Algorithms and coding, Programming languages like Python, C++, Java, R, and Distributed Computing. <br>

But That Is Just One Side Of The Story! <br>

Beyond technical skills, AI demands an innate sense of curiosity and a drive for problem-solving. Leaving technical background aside, an AI aspirant needs to be analytical to understand data and craft algorithms and be incredibly creative to solve problems with new and innovative solutions. Simply put, learning AI demands a combination of analytical ability, creativity, and problem-solving skills.
